# Python Practice
This is a text-based version of the classic Monopoly game.
I have recently started to learn Python, and this is my first major practice project.
The game incorporates all the major features of Monopoly, with a few caveats:
- The game is limited to a maximum of 4 players.
- There is a jackpot of $1000 (on Free Parking), with taxes and get-out-of-jail payments added to the jackpot.
- Each player can build up all of their monopoly properties up to a hotel (no shortage of houses for now)
- The Community Chest and Chance Cards are not the same as in the original. 
- Once the player has a negative cash balance, he will be forced to mortgage his properties
- The player loses, and is out of the game, once the cash balance is below zero and there are no unmortgaged properties
